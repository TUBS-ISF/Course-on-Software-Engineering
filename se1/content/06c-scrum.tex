		\begin{note}{Motivation \mysource{\sommerville}}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item businesses operate globally and in a rapidly changing environment
				\item software is part of almost all business operations
				\item new software has to be developed quickly
				\item often infeasible to derive a complete set of stable requirements
				\item plan-driven process models (e.g., waterfall) deliver software long after originally specified
			\end{itemize}

		\begin{definition}{Agile (Development) Methods \mysource{\sommerville}}
			Development of agile methods since late 1990s:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[1.] specification, design, implementation are interleaved
				\item[2.] each increment is specified and evaluated by stakeholders (e.g., end-users)
				\item[3.] extensive tool support is used

				\item[1.]<+-> \mycite{Our highest priority is to \emph{satisfy the customer} through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
					\item[2.]<+-> \emph{Welcome changing requirements}, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
					\item[3.]<+-> \emph{Deliver working software frequently}, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
					\item[4.]<+-> Business people and developers must \emph{work together daily} throughout the project.
					\item[5.]<+-> Build projects around \emph{motivated individuals}. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
					\item[6.]<+-> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is \emph{face-to-face conversation}.}

					\item[9.]<+-> Continuous attention to \emph{technical excellence and good design} enhances agility.
					\item[10.]<+-> \emph{Simplicity}--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
					\item[11.]<+-> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from \emph{self-organizing teams}.
					\item[12.]<+-> At regular intervals, the \emph{team reflects} on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.}

				\item unclear how scale to \emph{larger teams}
				\item problematic when \emph{contract negotiation} is required (as customer pays for development time rather then set of requirements)
				\item \emph{documentation and testing} not explicitly covered (requires extra story cards)
				\item requires \emph{continuous customer input}
				\item \emph{tacit knowledge} not available during maintenance (of long-life systems)
				\item detailed documentation required for \emph{external regulation} and \emph{outsourcing}
