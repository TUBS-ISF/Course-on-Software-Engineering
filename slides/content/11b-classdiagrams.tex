\subsection{Completeness of Attributes and Operations}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
	\begin{fancycolumns}
		\begin{note}{\umluserguide:}
			\mycite{When drawing a class, you don't have to show every attribute and every operation at once. In fact, in most cases, you can't (there are too many of them to put in one figure) and you probably shouldn't (only a subset of these attributes and operations are likely to be relevant to a specific view). For these reasons, you can elide a class, meaning that you can choose to show only some or none of a class's attributes and operations.}

\subsection{Aggregation and Composition of Classes}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
	\begin{fancycolumns}[animation=none]
		\begin{definition}{{Aggregation \mysource{adapted from \umluserguide}}}
			\emph{Aggregation} is a special association in which one class represents a larger thing (the whole), which consists of smaller things (the parts) (i.e., has-a relationship). In contrast, a plain association between two classes represents a structural relationship between peers, meaning that both classes are conceptually at the same level.
		\end{definition}
		\pause
		\begin{definition}{{Composition \mysource{\umluserguide}}}
			\mycite{\emph{Composition} is a form of aggregation, with strong ownership and coincident lifetime as part of the whole. Parts with non-fixed multiplicity may be created after the composite itself, but once created they live and die with it. Such parts can also be explicitly removed before the death of the composite.}

\subsection{Inheritance Relationships}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
	\begin{fancycolumns}[animation=none]
		\begin{definition}{Generalization and Abstract Classes}
			\mycite{A \emph{generalization} is a relationship between a general kind of thing (called the superclass or parent) and a more specific kind of thing (called the subclass or child). Generalization is sometimes called an is-a-kind-of relationship: one thing is-a-kind-of a more general thing.} If a superclass cannot be instantiated it is an \emph{abstract class} (also denoted with \textit{italic name}). \deutsch{Generali-\\sierung, abstrakte Klasse}\mysource{\umluserguide}
		\end{definition}
		\pause
		\begin{definition}{Interfaces and Realization}
			An \emph{interface} is a special class that only has static non-private attributes, abstract non-private operations, cannot be instantiated, and not be in a generalization relationship. Classes may \emph{realize} an interface. \deutsch{Schnittstelle, Realisierung}

\subsection{Rules and Hints for Class Diagrams}
\begin{frame}{\insertsubsection}
	\begin{fancycolumns}
		\begin{note}{Rules for Class Diagrams}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Class and attribute names are short nouns or noun phrases
				\item Operation names are verbs or short phrases starting with verbs
				\item Use camel case, whereas the first letter of attributes and operations is not capitalized
				\item A class has an arbitrary number of attributes/operations, any subset thereof shown in a diagram
				\item No cycles in inheritance relationships
				\item Abstract operations only live in abstract classes
				\item Interfaces cannot have private members (attributes/operations)
				\item Each class can only be a \textbf{part} of one composition
			\end{itemize}
		\end{note}
		\nextcolumn
		\begin{example}{{Hints on Inheritance \mysource{\umluserguide}}}
			\mycite{An object of the child class may be used for a variable or parameter typed by the parent, but not the reverse. In other words, generalization means that the child is substitutable for a declaration of the parent. A child inherits the properties of its parents, especially their attributes and operations. Often—but not always—the child has attributes and operations in addition to those found in its parents. An implementation of an operation in a child overrides an implementation of the same operation of the parent; this is known as polymorphism. To be the same, two operations must have the same signature (same name and parameters).}
